            <p>When I was in seventh grade my father somehow borrowed an Apple II+ computer. It came with 16k of memory
                (count the bytes, folks), a 4" black and white portable tv monitor and a cassete tape drive for
                storage. We tinkered around for a while with it. Then I locked myself into the basement for two weeks
                and emerged a BASIC programmer. That's how all this started.</p>
            <p>In high school I experienced a crisis. College was directly ahead of me and I had to make some hard
                choices. I studied voice and seriously considered majoring in Vocal
                Performance. On the other hand, Computer Science and Mathematics was attractive, too. There didn't seem
                to be a way to do all of them together. A Vocal major would likely end up with me in a cardboard box on
                Lower Wacker drive. CS/Math would provide me with food and shelter. I'm very big on food and thrive on
                shelter. That made my decision for me.</p>
            <p>I've been in the software business for over 25 years, starting in C, moving to C++, then lots of Java.
                Now I'm looking for an opportunity to expand my horizons with full-stack web development.</p>
            <p>When not hunched over a monitor I can be found camping in my small trailer, refereeing high school
                football games, going to the opera and symphony and finding the best source of dried kiwi.</p>
